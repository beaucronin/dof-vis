dof-vis is a simple interactive visualization to help understand the depth-of-field properties of various camera formats.

I wrote it because I was moving from full-frame (35mm) to micro four-thirds, and I wanted to understand what I would be giving up in terms of shallow depth of field (an advantage of larger formats).

You can see a running version of the visualization [here](FIXME).
