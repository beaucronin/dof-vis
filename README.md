dof-vis is a simple interactive visualization to help understand the depth-of-field properties of various camera formats.

I wrote it because I was moving from full-frame (35mm) to micro four-thirds, and I wanted to understand what I would be giving up in terms of shallow depth of field (an advantage of larger formats).

Formulas are from the [depth-of-field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field) wikipedia page, as are [circle of confusion values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_confusion).

Possible improvements:

* Add bokeh indicators to show which regions will be well-blurred
* Add better labels
* Use alternate depth-of-field formula for close-focus

You can see a running version of the visualization [here](http://npbay.es/dof.html).
